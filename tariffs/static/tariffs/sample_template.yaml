# Sample YAML Template for Tariff Bulk Upload
#
# This file demonstrates the structure for uploading tariffs with all charge types.

# Field Requirements:
# - Times: HH:MM format (e.g., "12:00" for noon)
# - Dates: YYYY-MM-DD format or null for year-round charges
#          Exact year is ignored; date ranges apply to all years
# - Decimals: Energy rates have up to 5 decimal places, others have 2
# - Booleans: true/false for applies_* fields (defaults to true if omitted)
#
# Validation Rules:
# - Period end time must be after start time
# - Applicable end date must be on or after start date (when both provided)
# - Utility must exist in database
# - Peak type must be "daily" or "monthly"
